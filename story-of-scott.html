      <p>My journey into this field (AI-optimization) as it is deeply rooted in a
        fascination with innovation and its power to shape our world. It wasn't a straight
        line, but more like a winding road through the fascinating landscapes of physics,
        academia, professorship, and finally, the world of AI (before it was cool).
        Personally, I DEFINE AI as nothing more than non-linear, multi-dimensional,
        heteroskadstic curve fitting.</p>

      <h2>Early Days: A Physics Foundation</h2>
      <p> </p>
      
      <h2>Stanford and Beyond: The Postdoc Years</h2>
      <p>My academic pursuits led me to Stanford University for a postdoctoral position. From 2010 to 2014, I delved deeper into research, expanding my knowledge and contributing to the scientific community. This period honed my analytical skills and nurtured my ability to tackle intricate challenges.</p>

      <h2>My time as a Professor</h2>
      <p>Full of chalkboard paint, artificial grass, and lawn chairs.</p>

      <h2>The Semiconductor World Beckons</h2>
      <p>In 2014, I transitioned from the halls of academia to the fast-paced world of semiconductor manufacturing. I joined Lam Research as a Data Scientist, where I first encountered the challenges of process optimization. The complexity of semiconductor fabrication, with its countless parameters and intricate processes, presented a new and exciting puzzle to solve.</p>

      <h2>Deep Dive into Deep Learning</h2>
      <p>At Lam Research, I immersed myself in the world of AI and deep learning. I developed innovative solutions for image analysis, using computer vision and deep learning models to analyze electron microscopic images and optimize etching and deposition processes. I also became proficient in Bayesian optimization techniques, a powerful tool for navigating the vast parameter spaces of semiconductor manufacturing.</p>

      <h2>Leading the Charge: Management and Mentorship</h2>
      <p>My technical expertise and leadership qualities led me to take on management roles. I led teams of talented data scientists, guiding them in developing cutting-edge algorithms and solutions. I also had the opportunity to share my knowledge and passion for data science as an instructor and mentor for internal training programs.</p>

      <h2>Applied Materials: Scaling New Heights</h2>
      <p>In 2022, I joined Applied Materials as a Senior Manager of Generative AI Algorithms. Here, I'm leading the development of a software product that empowers process engineers to optimize semiconductor fabrication using the power of AI. This role allows me to combine my deep understanding of AI with my passion for solving real-world challenges.</p>

      <h2>The Road Ahead: AI for a Better Future</h2>
      <p>My journey has been one of continuous learning and exploration. I'm excited to continue pushing the boundaries of AI, developing innovative solutions that not only optimize semiconductor processes but also contribute to advancements in other fields. I believe that AI has the potential to revolutionize industries and improve our lives in countless ways, and I'm committed to being a part of that transformation.</p>
