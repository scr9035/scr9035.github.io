                <h2>Core Ideas</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>The Build Trap:</b> This is the central concept of the book. It refers to the common situation where companies become overly focused on shipping features (outputs) rather than on achieving desired outcomes and creating value for customers. Organizations caught in the build trap are essentially "feature factories," churning out products without a clear understanding of whether they are actually solving real problems or achieving business goals.</li>
                    <li><b>Outcome-Focused Product Development:</b> Perri advocates for a shift towards outcome-focused product development. This means starting with a clear understanding of the desired business outcomes and customer needs, and then working backward to identify the solutions (features, products, etc.) that will best achieve those outcomes.</li>
                    <li><b>The Role of the Product Manager:</b> The book emphasizes the critical role of product managers in leading this transformation. Product managers are seen as the key individuals responsible for understanding customer needs, defining product strategy, and ensuring that development efforts are aligned with business goals.</li>
                    <li><b>Product Kata:</b> Perri introduces the "Product Kata" framework, inspired by the Toyota Kata, which provides a structured approach to experimentation and learning. It's a continuous improvement process that helps product teams iterate toward desired outcomes.</li>
                    <li><b>Buiding a Product-Led Organization:</b> Building a Product-Led Organization: The book provides guidance on how to build a product-led organization, where product thinking is embedded throughout the company, and decisions are driven by customer value and business outcomes.</li>

                <h2>Preface</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The Build Trap:</strong> Being so focused on shipping features and developing as many cool ideas as you can that you don't even think about the outcome of those features. It is when you stop connecting the goals of the company or the needs of your customers back to work you are creating.</li>
                    <li><strong>Common Phrases Heard When Caught in the Build Trap:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>"My bonus is tied to the features we ship. I need to get those out because it's getting close to the end of the year"</li>
                            <li>"My manager was getting upset because we were not shipping. I had to get something out the door or I'd get in trouble."</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Escaping the Build Trap:</strong> A guide to getting out of the build trap with great product management. It looks at what it means to become and be a product-led organization, which involves four key components:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Creating a product manager role with the right responsibilities and structure</li>
                            <li>Enabling those product managers with a strategy that promotes good decision making</li>
                            <li>Understanding the process of determining what product to build, through experimentation and optimization</li>
                            <li>Supporting everyone with the right organizational policies, culture, and rewards to allow product management to thrive.</li>
                            <li>The most important role you can have: student. [This is why it is crucial that product-led leaders have a growth mindset and that they are willing to learn and take advice from all contributors (from those above <em>and</em> below them on the org chart)]</li>
                        </ul>

                <h2>Part 1: The Build Trap</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Definition:</strong> The build trap is when organizations become stuck measuring their success by <em>outputs</em> rather than <em>outcomes</em>. It's when they focus more on shipping and developing features rather than on the actual value those things produce. When companies stop producing real value for users, they begin to lose market share, allowing them to be disrupted. Companies can get out of the build trap by setting themselves up to develop intentional and robust product management practices. At that point, product managers can find the opportunities to maximize business and customer value.</li>
                    <li><strong>Consequences:</strong> The build trap is a terrifying place for companies because it distracts them. Everyone is focused on shipping more software that they lose sight of what is important: producing value for customers, hitting business goals, and innovating against competitors.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mindset Shift:</strong> The build trap is about realizing you have to change the way you've always done things. It's about confusing output-centric measures of progress with real measures of value.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The Value Exchange System</h2>
                <img src=./value-exchange-simple-diagram.png alt="Value Exchange Diagram" width="600"/>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Misunderstanding Value:</strong> Companies end up in the build trap when they misunderstand value. [This is why I believe one of the most important, and difficult tasks is to create quantifiable metrics for providing customer and product value]</li>
                    <li><strong>Output vs. Outcome:</strong> Instead of associating value with outcomes they want to create for their business and customers, they measure value by the number of things they produce.</li>
                    <li><strong>Customer Value:</strong> The customer realizes <em>value</em> only when the customers' problems are resolved and their wants and needs are fulfilled.</li>
                    <li><strong>Business Value:</strong> Every feature you build and any initiative you take as a company should result in some outcome that is tied back to something that can fuel your business (i.e., money, data, knowledge capital, etc.). This is business value.</li>
                    <li><strong>Measuring Value:</strong> [Yep, I stated this above] Value can be difficult to measure and to measure well from a customer or user perspective. Products and services are not inherently valuable. It's what they do for the customer or user that has the value -- solving a problem, for example, or fulfilling a desire or need. [This is why I believe in having a guiding vision and requirements document. So you don't lose sight of what value you are trying to bring.]</li>
                    <li><strong>Lack of Customer Understanding:</strong> When companies do not understand their customers' or users' problems well, they cannot possibly define value for them. Instead of doing the work to learn this information about customers, they create a proxy that is easy to measure. "Value" becomes the quantity of features that are delivered, and, as a result, the number of features shipped becomes the primary metric of success.</li>
                    <li><strong>Detrimental Motivation:</strong> These companies then motivate their employees and judge them for success with the same proxies. Developers are rewarded for fine-tuning interactions and creating pixel-perfect designs. Product managers are rewarded for writing long specification documents, or creating extensive backlogs. The team is rewarded for shipping features. This thinking is detrimental yet pervasive.</li>
                    <li><strong>Author's Example:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Company over-promised during a sales process, giving customers whatever it took to get the contract signed. The result was a ton of one-off features that satisfied the needs of only one client, rather than a strategic choice to build would scale for many clients. [Why scaling is really important to think about. Not building a one of product to handle one demo, but something that can provide value across all demos]</li>
                            <li>Instead of analyzing how each of these features provided unique value to its customers and moving the company strategy forward, the organization was stuck in reactive mode. <em>It was not building with intent.</em></li>
                            <li>You have to get to know your customers and users. To gain this understanding you need to get employees closer to their customers and users, which means having the right policies throughout the organization to enable this. [Gate-keeping, silo-structures, and rigidly defined roles and responsibilities hinder this]</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                <h2>Constraints on the Value Exchange System</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Outputs:</strong> <em>Outputs</em> are easily quantified things that we produce -- number of products or features, number of releases, or velocity of development teams.</li>
                    <li><strong>Outcomes:</strong> <em>Outcomes</em> are the things that result when we finally deliver those features and the customer problems are solved.</li>
                </ul>

            <section class="chapter">
                <h2>Project Versus Product Versus Services</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Products:</strong> <em>Products</em> are vehicles of value. They deliver value repeatedly to customers and users without requiring the company to build something new every time [the word repeatedly here really highlights the importance of building a product that can scale].</li>
                    <li><strong>Services:</strong> <em>Services</em>, unlike products, use human labor to primarily deliver value to the user.</li>
                    <li><strong>Projects:</strong> <em>Project</em>, a discrete scope of work that has a particular aim. Usually has a deadline, milestones, and specific outputs that will be delivered. When projects are complete, the aims reached, and you move on to the next one. Projects are an essential part of product development, but the mentality of thinking only in projects will cause damage.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Importance of Product Management:</strong> This is why the concept of product management -- and that of having product managers -- is so important: you need the discipline to move toward organizing for products over projects. Companies that optimize their products to achieve value are called product-led organizations. The organizations are characterized by product-driven growth, scaling their organization through software products, and optimizing them until they reach the desired outcomes.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The Product-Led Organization</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Definition:</strong> <em>Product-led</em> companies understand that the success of their products is the primary driver of growth and value for their company. They prioritize, organize, and strategize around product success. [I actually obsess over this. Probably too much, given my current role]. This is what gets a company out of the build trap.</li>
                    <li><strong>Other Leadership Models (and their pitfalls):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><em>Sales-led</em>: Contracts define product strategy; roadmap driven by sales promises, without strategic alignment; difficulty scaling. Their sales process gets ahead of their product strategy, and they continually need to play catch-up to make their commitments. This leaves no room for product teams to strategize or explore what could push the company further.</li>
                            <li><em>Visionary-led</em>: Powerful with the right visionary, but not sustainable; innovation shouldn't rely on a single person.</li>
                            <li><em>Technology-led</em>: Driven by the latest technology; often lacks a market-facing, value-led strategy.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Characteristics of Product-Led Organizations:</strong> Product-led companies optimize for their business outcomes, align their product strategy to these goals, and then prioritize the most effective projects that will help develop those products into sustainable drivers of growth. [Notice the word sustainable, it suggests I'm correct in thinking and prioritizing scaling over getting something out the door]. To become product-led, you need to take a look at the roles, the strategy, the process, and the organization itself.</li>

                <h2>What We Know and What We Don't</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Known-Known = Facts:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Identifying what you know to be true about the situation.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Known-Unknown = Questions:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>These are clarified enough that you know what question to ask. They are assumptions that you want to test, data points that you can investigate, or problems that you can identify and explore. You use discovery methods and experimentation to clarify these and turn them into Facts.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Unknown-Known = Intuition:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>i.e., those moments when you say, "I feel like this is the right thing to do."</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Unknown-Unknowns = Discovery:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>These are the things you don't know you don't know. You don't know well enough to ask the right questions or identify the knowledge gaps. These tend to be moments of surprise that need to be discovered.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Product Management's Domain:</strong> Product management is the domain of recognizing and investigating the known unknowns and of reducing the universe around the unknown unknowns. Product managers identify features and products that will solve customer problems while achieving business goals. They optimize the Value Exchange System. Most roles in companies do not cross over much between the tech side and business side. Product managers fit right in the middle and translate needs into a product that will satisfy the customer while sustaining and growing the business.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Importance of Product Managers:</strong> Product managers are the key to becoming product-led.</li>
