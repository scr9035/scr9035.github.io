                <h3>2.1 Sizing Teams</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Manager-to-Engineer Ratio:</strong> Managers should typically support 6-8 engineers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Manager-of-Managers Ratio:</strong> Managers of managers should support 4-6 managers.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2.2.2 Dealing with Stakeholder Impatience</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>When a team is repaying technical debt, stakeholders often become impatient for new feature delivery.</li>
                    <li><strong>Obligation:</strong> Prevent this impatience from causing a backslide into accumulating more debt.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="chapter">
                <h3>2.3.1 Team-First Mentality</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>High-Performing Teams:</strong> Sustained productivity comes from high-performing teams. Disassembling them significantly reduces productivity, even if individual members are retained.</li>
                    <li><strong>Value of Stability:</strong> High-performing teams are sacred and take time to gel. Shifting individuals across teams can reset this process, particularly when team cultures differ significantly.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="chapter">
                <h3>2.3.3 The Cost of Adding Resources</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Counterintuitive Slowdowns:</strong> Adding resources to a team can often slow it down due to the creation of new upstream constraints.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="chapter">
                <h3>2.3.4 Scope Shifts and Rotations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Shifting Scope:</strong> Shifting project scope is generally preferable to moving people, as it avoids the costs of re-gelling and preserves existing system behavior.</li>
                    <li><strong>Temporary Rotations:</strong> Rotating individuals for a fixed period into areas needing help can be effective. This allows them to retain their primary team identity while providing focused support.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="chapter">
                <h3>2.4.3 Managing Entropy Through System Design</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Flexible Software Design:</strong> Design software to be flexible from the start. This is described as "fail open and layer policy."</li>
                    <li><strong>Avoid Rewrites:</strong> The best system rewrite is the one that doesn't happen. Avoid baking in arbitrary policy decisions that are likely to change.</li>
                    <li><strong>Generic Interfaces:</strong> Keep interfaces generic to avoid complex migration phases during system updates. This allows for faster iteration and reduces the need to maintain multiple versions. While there's a cost to maintaining an extra layer of abstraction, it can save time and effort in the long run, especially after multiple rewrites.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gatekeeping:</strong> Using humans for gatekeeping can create negative social dynamics and is inefficient. Treat gatekeeping as a bug, not a feature. This appears to be more prevalent in cultures without a strong hierarchical structure, such as those with mandatory military service.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

              <h3>Organizational Risk</h3>
              <ul>
                  <li><strong>Organizational Debt:</strong> Similar to technical debt, organizational debt arises from compromises made to "just get it done." It involves people and cultural issues.</li>
                  <li><strong>Managing Organizational Debt:</strong>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Identify a few areas of organizational debt to actively improve.</li>
                        <li>Ensure you're making progress in these areas.</li>
                        <li>Give yourself permission to do other areas poorly.</li>
                        <li>Develop an explicit plan with your manager and agree on what constitutes reasonable progress.</li>
                        <li>These issues are still stored with your other bags of risk and responsibility, but you've agreed on expectations.</li>
                      </ul>
                  </li>
              </ul>

            <h3>2.6.1 Defining Your Role</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Document Your Role:</strong> In meetings, write down your role to clarify responsibilities and expectations.</li>
            </ul>
