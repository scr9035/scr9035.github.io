                        <li>When the team is repaying debt, your stakeholders are probably antsy waiting for the team to start delivering new stuff, and your obligation is to prevent that impatience from causing a backslide!</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Sustained productivity comes from high-performing teams, and disassembling a high-performing team leads to a significant loss of productivity, even if the members are fully retained.</li>
                        <li>High-performing teams are sacred.</li>
                        <li>Teams take a long time to jell. Shifting individuals across teams can reset the clock on jelling, especially when there are significant differences in team culture.</li>

                    <h3>2.3.4 Shift Scope; Rotate</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Shifting scope works better than moving people because it avoids re-jelling costs, and it preserves system behavior.</li>
                        <li>The other approach that I've seen work well is to rotate individuals for a fixed period into an area that needs help. The fixed duration allows them to retain their identity and membership in their current team, giving their full focus to helping out, rather than splitting their focus between performing the work and finding membership in the new team.</li>

                    <h3>2.4.3 Ways to Manage Entropy</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>IMO, the most important opportunity is designing your software to be flexible. I've described this as "fail open and layer policy": <strong>the best system rewrite is the one that didn't happen</strong>, and if you can <strong>avoid baking in arbitrary policy decisions</strong> that will change frequently over time, then you are much more likely to be able to keep using a system for the long term.</li>
                        <li><strong>If you can keep your interfaces generic, then you will be able to skip the migration phase of system re-implementation, which tends to be the longest and trickiest phase, and you can iterate much more quickly</strong> and maintain fewer concurrent versions. There is absolutely a cost to maintaining the extra layer of indirection, but if you've already rewritten a system twice, take the time to abstract the interface as part of the third rewrite and thank yourself later. (By the time you'd do the fourth rewrite, you'd be dealing with migrating six times as many engineers).</li>
                        <li>Having humans who perform gate-keeping activities creates very odd social dynamics and is rarely a great use of a human's time. [This is an American cultural standard, where hierarchy doesn't exist like in cultures where military service is required, I think]</li>
                        <li>Treat gate-keeping as a significant implementation bug rather than as a stability feature to be emulated.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Organizational debt is the sibling of technical debt. <strong>[Organizational debt is all the people/culture compromises made to “just get it done”]</strong></li>
                        <li>What I've found most successful is to identify a few [organizational debt] areas to improve, ensure you're making progress on those, and give yourself permission to do the rest poorly. Work with your manager to write this up as an explicit plan and agree on what reasonable progress looks like. These issues are still stored with your other bags of risk and responsibility, but you've agreed on expectations.</li>

                    <h3>3.2.1 Problem Discovery</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The first phase of a planning cycle is exploring the different problems that you could pick up to solve. It's surprisingly common to skip this phase, but that, unsurprisingly, leads to inertia-driven local optimization. Taking the time to evaluate which problem to solve is one of the best predictors I've found of a team's long-term performance. [This is why we build the goals and requirements documents. This also highlights the importance of project planning.]</li>
                        <li><strong>Compounding Leverage:</strong> What are the composable blocks you could start building today that would compound into major product or technical leverage over time? I think of this category of work as finding ways to get the benefit at least twice. These are potentially tasks that initially don't seem important enough to prioritize, but whose compounding value makes the work possible to prioritize. [This is the core ethos behind our road-map.]</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>After experimenting with a handful of different approaches, agreeing on strategy and vision has been the most effective approach that I've found to alignment at scale.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Strategies</em> are grounded documents that explain the trade-offs and actions that will be taken to address a specific challenge. <em>Visions</em> are aspirational documents that enable individuals who don't work closely together to make decisions that fit together cleanly.</li>

                        <li>A <em>strategy</em> recommends specific actions that address a given challenge's constraints. A structure that I've found extremely effective has three sections: diagnosis, policies, and actions.
                            <ul>
                                <li><em>Diagnosis</em> is a theory describing the challenge at hand. at its core it is a very thorough problem statement.</li>
                                <li><em>Policies</em> describe the general approach that you'll take and are often trade-offs between two competing goals.</li>
                                <li><em>Actions</em> are when you apply your guiding policies to your diagnosis.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>If strategies describe the harsh trade-offs necessary to overcome a particular challenge, then <em>visions</em> describe a future in which those trade-offs are no longer mutually exclusive.</li>
                        <li>A vision is comprised of: vision statement, value proposition, capabilities, solved constraints, future constraints, reference materials, narrative.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Migrations are the sole scalable fixes to technical debt.</li>
                        <li>Migrations matter because they usually are the only available avenue to make meaningful progress on technical debt.</li>
                        <li>Engineers hate technical debt. [Yeah, because we are the ones that have to eventually fix ad-hoc short term managerial decisions and understand the technical scope of these decisions]</li>
                        <li>Engineering managers hate technical debt, too. [I wonder what happens going from Eng. manager to director that causes the switch in thinking about technical debt? Is it as a director you no longer have are responsible to the work involved in fixing tech debt?]</li>
                        <li>Each migration aims to create technical leverage or reduce tech debt.</li>
                        <li>Migrations are the only mechanisms to effectively manage technical debt as your company and code grow.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>In particular, starting but not finishing migrations often incurs significant technical debt, so your incentives and recognition structure should be careful to avoid perverse incentives.</li>

                        <li>Biggest positive impact on your organizations success: making technical migrations cheap (i.e., avoiding tech debt), and running clean re-organizations.</li>

                                <li>Validate that an organization change is the right tool. The two best types of re-org is one that solves a problem, and the one you don't do.</li>
                                <li>Project head-count at least one year out</li>
                                <li>Have the correct manager-to-engineer ratio. If engineering managers are expected to do hands-on technical work then their team should likely be 3-to-5 engineers</li>

You can't reason about organizations purely from either direction. There are many exceedingly valid, different ways to think about any given re-organization, and you should use these ideas as one model for thinking through changes, not as a definitive roadmap.</li>

                    <h3>4.2 Saying No</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>[This is my personal belief as well, and I'm excited it was stated so well in this book] "It was in that era of my career that I came to view management as, at its core, a <strong>moral profession</strong>. We have the opportunity to create an environment for those around us to be their best, in <strong>fair</strong> surroundings. For me, that's both an opportunity and an obligation for managers, and saying no in that room with my manager and CTO was, in part, my decision to hold the line on what's right."</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Folks who communicate a 'no' effectively are not the firmest of speakers, nor do they make frequent use of the word itself. They are able to convincingly explain their teams' constraints and articulate why the proposed path is either unattainable or undesirable. [I need to improve in this area of influence]</li>
                        <li>Articulating your constraints depends on the particulars of the issue at hand, but Will finds two topics are frequent venues of disagreement. The first is <strong>velocity</strong>: Why is this taking so long when it should take a couple of hours? The other is <strong>prioritization</strong>: Why can't you work on this other, more important project?</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Break tasks into three discrete steps:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Document all incoming tasks</li>
                                <li>Develop guiding principles for how work is selected</li>
                                <li>Share subsets of tasks you've selected based on those guiding principles</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Keep asking the team and your manager, "does this seem like the right list of asks?"</li>
                        <li>[Commonplace within orgs that have little experience with software / deep learning development and execution] "The most controversial guides tend to be statements about the value of current work versus future work, for example, doing investment work today that will pay off in two years but limit value in the short term. One technique that Will has found useful for this particular scenario is specifying quotas for both immediate and long-term work"</li>
                        <li>How do we get management to appreciate and understand mid-to-long term investment (i.e., appreciating technical debt, and software architecture)?</li>
                        <li>When a stakeholder disagrees with your priorities:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Understand the stakeholder requests</li>
                                <li>Sit down with them, test their ask against your guiding principles and current prioritized work.</li>
                                <li>If their request is more important than your current work, shift priorities <em>at your next planning meeting</em>.</li>
                                <li>To limit churn created by shifting priorities, wait until the next planning meeting. Have planning meetings at minimum once a month.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>My mantra for guiding decision-making: do the right thing for the company, the right thing for the team, and the right thing for yourself, in that order</li>
                        <li>This usually results in burning social capital, especially in organizations who can't admit to mistakes, or who's primary goal is to be promoted. Ego management and gate-keeping tend to take hold in organizations like this.</li>
                        <li>This mantra suggests "pushing back on a timeline that would force your team into a death march, even though it's uncomfortable to have that conversation with your manager or your product partner". [I feel good managers are OK with telling uncomfortable truths to VPs instead of comforting lies. As a matter of fact great managers understand this is part of their core responsibility.]</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>[Very important list. I'm only going to include ones I think I need to improve on, or ones I've seen in my professional career]</li>
                        <li>Only manage up.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Some managers focus so much on following their management's wishes that their team evaporates beneath them</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Don't spend time building relationships
                            <ul>
                                <li>Your team's impact depends largely on doing something that other teams or customers want, and getting it shipped out the door. This is extraordinarily hard without a supportive social network within the company (i.e., no gate-keeping, open dialogue, growth mindset)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Forget that their manager is a human being
                            <ul>
                                <li>It's easy to get frustrated when your manager puts you in a bad situation. To have a good relationship with your manager, you have to give them room to make mistakes.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Abscond rather than delegate
                            <ul>
                                <li>Delegation is important, but it's easy to go too far and for the manager to ignore the critical responsibilities they have asked others to take on.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Become disconnected from ground truth
                            <ul>
                                <li>Particular at larger companies, it can become frequent to make decision that appear to be fundamentally disconnected from reality.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Mistake title for impact</li>
                        <li>Confuse authority with truth
                            <ul>
                                <li>Authority lets one get away with weak arguments and poor justifications, but it's a pretty expensive way to work with people, because (if they are in a complicated compensation or life situation) they'll eventually turn off their minds and simply follow orders. <strong>Otherwise, they'll just leave</strong>.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Only see the problems
                            <ul>
                                <li>It's easy to see what's going wrong, and forget to celebrate the good stuff. Down this path lies frustration and madness.</li>

                                <li>First phase is to cast the widest net possible for ideas. Do this by talking to folks who have worked at different companies (especially if you've only worked at one for a long time), and ask what those companies did really well.</li>
                                <li>Talk to your team or adjacent team and see if there are ideas to draw out that they've been noodling on but haven't yet volunteered.</li>
                                <li><strong>Read some new technical papers</strong></li>
                                <li>Use your network and reach out to people in your social network at interesting/different companies</li>

                        <li>Once you have the problems, talk with experienced leaders at other companies, and ask them how they've solved these issues. Ask them for their stores.</li>
                        <li>In order for this to work you need to distill your strategy and sensitivity analysis document into something short and comprehensible.</li>

                    <h3>4.9 Close Out, Solve, or Delegate</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For every problem that comes your way (i.e., an email asking for a decision, a production problem, a dispute around on-call, a request to transfer from one team to another) you should pick one of three options:
                            <ul>
                                <li><u>Close out</u>. Close it out in a way such that this specific ask is entirely resolved.</li>
                                <li><u>Solve</u>. Design a solution such that you won't need to spend time on this particular kind of ask again in the next six months</li>
                                <li><u>Delegate</u>. Ideally, this is to redirect the ask to someone who is responsible for that kind of work, but sometimes it is a one-off.</li>

                        </li>
